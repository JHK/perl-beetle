NAME
    Beetle - High availability AMQP messaging with redundant queues

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This is the Perl implementation of the Ruby Beetle project. More
    information can be found on the <http://xing.github.com/beetle>.

    Beetle grew out of a project to improve an existing ActiveMQ based
    messaging infrastructure. It offers the following features:

    *   High Availability (by using multiple message broker instances)

    *   Redundancy (by replicating queues)

    *   Simple client API (by encapsulating the publishing/ deduplication
        logic)

    Sorry, currently there're no docs yet, please take a look into
    "examples/" and/or the tests.
