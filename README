NAME
    Beetle - High availability AMQP messaging with redundant queues

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This is the Perl implementation of the Ruby Beetle project. The Perl
    implementation is as close as possible to the Ruby one. More information
    can be found on <http://xing.github.com/beetle/>.

    Beetle grew out of a project to improve an existing ActiveMQ based
    messaging infrastructure. It offers the following features:

    *   High Availability (by using multiple message broker instances)

    *   Redundancy (by replicating queues)

    *   Simple client API (by encapsulating the publishing/ deduplication
        logic)

    The main documentation can be found in Beetle::Client which is the
    public interface to the Beetle::Subscriber and the Beetle::Publisher.
    There are also some examples in the distribution in "examples/".
