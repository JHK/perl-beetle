* proper exceptions handling using exception objects + Try::Tiny
* fix ISA of attributes
* fix rw/ro of attributes
* fix private/public methods/attributes
* verify all calls to the Net::RabbitMQ objects are correct
* fix: DESTROY created new reference to dead object 'AnyEvent::RabbitMQ' during global destruction.
* -maybe- implement following optional things (again):
  * rpc
  * reply_to
  * trace
* fix handle_exception in Beetle::Message, still not sure I got it 100% right
